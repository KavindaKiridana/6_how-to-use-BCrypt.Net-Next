# üöÄ Password Encryption with BCrypt.NET

This is a simple C# project demonstrating how to securely hash passwords using the **BCrypt.NET-Next** package. Perfect for beginners learning about password encryption!

---

## üìÇ What This Project Does

- Shows how to **hash a password** using BCrypt.  
- Demonstrates how to **verify a password** against its hash.  
- Utilizes the **BCrypt.NET-Next NuGet package** for secure password handling.  

---

## üìÇ Getting Started  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New C# Console Project  
Run the following command to create a new console project:  
```bash
dotnet new console
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install the BCrypt.NET-Next Package  
Add the BCrypt.NET-Next package to your project:  
```bash
dotnet add package BCrypt.Net-Next
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add the Code  
Copy the following code to `Program.cs` to learn how:  

- Passwords are hashed.  
- Hashed passwords are verified.  
- Previously saved hashes can be validated.  

---

## üìú Code Example  

```csharp
// Create a password
string password = "123";

// Hash the password
string hashedPassword = BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.EnhancedHashPassword(password);

// Verify the password matches its hash
bool verify = BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.EnhancedVerify(password, hashedPassword);

// Output the results
Console.WriteLine($"Password: {password}");
Console.WriteLine($"Hashed Password: {hashedPassword}");
Console.WriteLine($"Password Verified: {verify}");
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes  

- **Never store plain text passwords** in your code or database.  
- Every time you hash the same password, you‚Äôll get a **different hash**.  
- Despite being different each time, the hash can always verify the original password.  
- **BCrypt** is intentionally designed to be slow to mitigate brute-force attacks.  

---

### üí° Why Use BCrypt?  

- **Built-in Salt**: Adds randomness to prevent hash collisions.  
- **Adjustable Work Factor**: Makes brute-force attacks more difficult over time.  
- **Proven Security**: Widely used and trusted by developers worldwide.  

---

## üéâ Conclusion  

Using BCrypt.NET, you can ensure secure password handling in your applications. This project provides a simple starting point to understand password encryption and verification.
